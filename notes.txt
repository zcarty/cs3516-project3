We write the IPv4 and UDP header
	IPv4:
		when saying from: and to:, use overlay addresses instead of real
	UDP:
		source
		destination
		
Router looks up dest IP,
	in forwarding table (trie)
	figures out which router to send to:
	sendto(router_ip)
	**(automatic) rewrite header with source router as source ip 
	
do we use the ip addresses in the config file or can we slightly alter them

same exe for router or endpoint
w/cmd line args
